Online Companion to Wayne's Poster for Retreat 2016
===================================================

FIX SINCE IT IS RST AND NOT MARKDOWN!!

Links and resources for Jupyter Notebook and how to link active notebooks to Github from poster at Upstate Medical University's Biomedical Sciences Retreat 2016. ** Poster entitled: Biomedical Science on Jupyter: Comprehensible and Reproducible Scientific Workflows with Shared, Active Jupyter Notebooks **

Notable Notebooks
-----------------

See the final page of this online documentation for the list of example Jupyter Notebooks mentioned on the poster. See that page as well as for  the list of those notebooks using the Github/Binder approach.

To get there, the easiest way is to press `Next` at the bottom of this page and the next.

Launch Demo Binder
------------------
Do I link to the github repo/page with button or directly launch from these links? Probably to the repo page because then can direct to the static one and then back to launch an active

Put a Button here to Career Day One or a better example? (The positives about that one is that it has graphing and some tasks that take some power, but is it easy to run?



EDIT BELOW HERE IN THIS SECTION TO HAVE CORRECT LINKS

Below you can press the `launch binder` button below to launch an active notebook. Play around with it and then come back here.

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/repo/fomightez/uscad16/notebooks/Decoding%20translation%20in%20the%20cloud%20and%20at%20NCBI.ipynb)

This was a very simple notebook that has a good mix of the features as it was meant to touch casually on some molecular biology aspects while introducing the Jupyter Notebook system to some high school students that visited Upstate.

The repository hosting that Jupyter Notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/fomightez/uscad16). There you will see a link to the [static notebook](https://github.com/fomightez/uscad16/blob/master/Decoding%20translation%20in%20the%20cloud%20and%20at%20NCBI.ipynb). You can also launch an active notebook from that reposiotry using the `launch binder` button there.

To get the `launch binder` button to work I had to previously tell the Freeman Lab's Binder system found at [mybinder.org](http://mybinder.org/) to build a `binder` from the repository at Github. That `binder` then becomes available for users to spin up notebooks on-demand, essentially instantaneously.

These links will take you to the Github page where you'll see links to the static notebooks as well as buttons to launch the notebooks as active notebooks using the Freeman Lab's Binder system found at [mybinder.org](http://mybinder.org/):
