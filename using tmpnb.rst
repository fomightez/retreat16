Appendix: Using tmpnb.org or try.jupyter.org
============================================

Get an active notebook running
------------------------------

-  Go to `tmpnb.org <tmpnb.org>`__ or
   `try.jupyter.org <try.jupyter.org>`__ and you'll see a ``dashboard``
   like below.

-  If you already have a notebook file, click ``upload`` on the upper
   right side of the dashboard, and then point the browser at your file.

Click ``okay`` and then the notebook will show the name of your file at
the top of the ``dashboard``. Click the ``upload`` button next to that
to actually upload.

Once uploaded, click on it in the list of notebooks to launch.

In the example above, the uploaded notebook
``Jupyter Notebook Basics.ipynb`` is now ready to be clicked on to
initiate launch.

-  If you have no notebook, select one from the list or click ``New``
   and choose your language option.

(You can acquire notebook files from many sources that you could then
upload for active use using the process outlined above. Several of such
sources can be found by finding the Github accounts linked to the
notebooks referenced
`here <http://retreat16.readthedocs.io/en/latest/references%20by%20section/>`__.)

Try the notebook
----------------

Tips:

::

    - hit shift-enter to run a cell.
    - the pull-down menu in the toolbar lets you switch cells from `code` to `markdown` but there are also short-cuts.
    - Fom inside the notebook you can always return to the `dashboard` by clicking the Jupyter logo in the upper left side.

-  **REMEMBER THE ACTIVE FORM IS EPHEMERAL.** If you did anything that
   you are happy with, be sure to save it locally by going to ``File`` >
   ``Download as`` > ``Notebook`` and saving the file on your drive.
   Later you can use the ``upload`` process covered in the first part
   above to resume using it as an active notebook.
