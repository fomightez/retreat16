   Research <http://www.nature.com/news/reproducibility-1.17552#/Recent-articles>`__

-  `Full Computational Reproducibility in Biological Science: Methods,
   Software and a Case Study in Protein
   Biology <http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06897>`__

-  `Reproducibility, repeatability, and a workshop in
   Norway <http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2016-norway-repeatability.html>`__

-  `Interactive notebooks: Sharing the code by Helen Shen. Nature. 2014
   Nov 6;515(7525):151-2. doi: 10.1038/515151a. PMID:
   25373681 <http://www.nature.com/news/interactive-notebooks-sharing-the-code-1.16261>`__.
   This article is a couple of years old now but gives a good background
   on the issues and impetus for now what are Jupyter Notebooks.

-  `How Jupyter Notebooks Will Improve Your Computational
   Life <http://wp.sanger.ac.uk/barrettgroup/2016/03/10/how-jupyter-notebooks-will-improve-your-computational-life/>`__
   - a nice illustrated introduction to Jupyter Notebooks

-  `An brief introduction to Jupyter Notebook essentials that is meant
   to be hands-on, posted by Titus Brown as part of a recent one day
   seminar <https://2016-oslo-repeatability.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro-jupyter.html>`__

-  `IPython Notebook/Project Jupyter Half day
   Workshop <http://dib-training.readthedocs.io/en/pub/2016-03-09-jupyter-notebook.html>`__

    "Project Jupyter is a literate data analysis environment (similar to
    knitr and Shiny) that supports over 40 different programming
    languages, including R and Python both. It can be used to build
    reproducible analyses for publication, collaborate over distances on
    data analysis, and build interactive tutorials and homeworks around
    data analysis."

-  `A gallery of interesting IPython
   Notebooks <https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks>`__,
   in particular see `Reproducible academic publications
   section <https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks#reproducible-academic-publications>`__
   . Some other notebooks are highlighted
   `here <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/>`__.

-  `Installation, Configuration, and
   Usage <http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/projects/content-projects.html>`__
   - start here if you need a solution not provided by tmpnb.org or the
   Github/Binder combination; the site will suggest the Anaconda
   distribution of Python associated environment as the easiest route
   for installing Jupyter Notebooks. Alternatively, if you rather easily
   work in the cloud and not be linked to one machine, I suggest a
   `SageMathCloud <https://cloud.sagemath.com/>`__ account as it is the
   only option I can confirm works on Upstate's network due to campus
   firewall. `Domino Data Lab <http://www.dominodatalab.com/>`__ and
   `Wakari.io <https://www.wakari.io/>`__ are other places that offer a
   place to develop Jupyter Notebooks in the cloud but last time I
   checked their implementation was incompatible with Upstate's network.

-  `Introduction to Applied Bioinformatics (or IAB) is a free, open
   source interactive text that introduces readers to core concepts of
   bioinformatics in the context of their implementation and
   application. <http://readiab.org/>`__ - uses Jupyter notebooks and
   mybinder.org

-  `Exploratory Computing with
   Python <http://mbakker7.github.io/exploratory_computing_with_python/>`__
   - a collection of notebooks helpful for learning Python and
   illustrative of the exploratory computing aproach

    "Lots of books are written on scientific computing, but very few
    deal with the much more common exploratory computing (a term coined
    by Fernando Perez), which represents daily tasks of many scientists
    and engineers that try to solve problems but are not computer
    scientists. This set of Notebooks is written for scientists and
    engineers who want to use Python programming for exploratory
    computing, scripting, data analysis, and visualization. Python makes
    many of these programming tasks quick and easy and, probably most
    importantly, fun.""

-  `Freeman Lab's MyBinder.org site <http://mybinder.org>`__ - where
   you'll go to point their system at your Github repository with a
   Jupyer Notebook to make active notebooks available online

-  `Is mybinder 95% of the way to next-gen computational science
   publishing, or only
   90%? <http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2016-mybinder.html>`__

    "The split that my lab has made here is to use a workflow engine
    (e.g. make, pydoit, or snakemake) for the compute & data intensive
    stuff, and then feed those intermediate results (assembly and
    mapping stats, quantification, etc.) into analysis notebooks. For
    mybinder purposes, there should be no problem saving those
    intermediate results into a github repo for us and everyone else to
    analyze and reanalyze."

-  `tmpnb.org <http://tmpnb.org>`__ or
   `try.jupyter.org <https://try.jupyter.org/>`__ - launch active,
   transient Jupyter Notebooks in the cloud for basic development, see
   `Instant Temporary IPython
   Notebooks <https://lambdaops.com/ipythonjupyter-tmpnb-debuts/>`__
